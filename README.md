# Fullstack take home

## Running the project 

1. Copy/Rename the [`.env.example`](./.env.example) to make `.env`. (I have still populated the [`.env.example`](./.env.example) to avoid sharing the values separately and it does not contain super important info)

2. Then use the command
    ```
    docker compose up --build
    ```
>**Note:** If you are using the ports that are already used by this project feel free to change them in the `.env` you create.
